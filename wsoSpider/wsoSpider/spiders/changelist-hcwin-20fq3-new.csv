Under normal case, the createInstance promise is resolved upon receiving createInstanceResult webtext. There is no conflict.However, if the websocket is closed after createInstance is sent, but before createInstanceResult gets received. The cleanup() will try to cancel all the promise, which triggers the createInstance promise calls cleanup again. This forms a loop until the stack overflowed in the javascript.This change fixed this issue.QA Notes: Testing Done:1. Reproed this by manually disconnect before sending createInstanceResult.2.

Connect into a remote desktop and open VmwAmcap.exe or other video capture software to use RTAV;2. Close the app;3. Re-open the app to use RTAV;==> Issue occurred: the video capture doesn't work(but audio works).[Root cause]1. When stopping the video capture by quitting the app(NOT quitting remote agent), we will stop the capture.2. It needs some time to stop the capture thus we use a task to do that asynchronously.3. However, user opened the app to start the capture before the above stopping action completed.   ===> Issue occurred as the device is still in usage.[Solution] - Stop the video capture in a synchronous action.   As we are not in UI thread, it is OK and proper to do that.- As a result, CameraCapture::CleanupMediaCaptureAsync is renamed to CameraCapture::CleanupMediaCapture.   This is the main change!!!We also had a check on the valid FPS for the media formats of the webcam device. - On the agent side, the valid FPS is [1, 25].   ",,,[UWP RTAV] Fixed the issue that the front/rear webcam devices didn't work on some devices.,bliu,https://p4web.eng.vmware.com:443/@md=d&cd=//&c=UXC@/7288351?ac=10

After USB device is automatically redirected, USBDevices::HandleUSBConnect will be called.2. In the above function, the 2nd parameter is with type CdkViewUsb_ConnectData, which as a member ""autoconnect"".   When auto-redirection happened, the above parameter is 1.3. Another member ""connected"" indicates whether it is redirected(value: 1) or disconnected(value: 0).4. We could disable/enable AV buffering with the above two data members.In this patch, we also re-factored USBDevices::DisableBufferWithoutAudio to make it more clear:1. A new function USBDevices::ShouldDisableBufferWithoutAudio is added.   This function contains all the checking points whether it is proper to disable/enable AV buffering.2.
